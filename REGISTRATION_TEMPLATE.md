## Project Description 
Contracting in Web3 has an accountability problem because the pseudonymity of contributors diminishes their eagerness to focus on delivery. To address this shortcoming, our project introduces bid bonds to the Sui ecoosystem and make them available to the community through a bounty board. The concept is prevalent in traditional public and private sector contracting, but has yet to be implemented for Web3 to provide transparency to digital trade and democratise on-chain economies. Bid bonds can effectively mitigate risks associated with project defaults, particularly in grant programs that currently rely on milestone-based payments by requiring contractors to deposit a security.

Through our experience in the development of decentralised identity and Web3 credentialing we have not only enabled decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) contributors to use real-world identities for finding work in Web3, but also identified a concept to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks for enhancing the process behind bid bonds. Our solution proposes to replace traditional centralised third parties with a combination of Web3 credentials and staking contracts. This innovative solution not only streamlines the process but also introduces more efficient contracting methods in Web3 and beyond.
