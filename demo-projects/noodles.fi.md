## Project Description

One-stop-shop for Sui. Users can access news, advanced market insights, and DeFi opportunities in one single app. Custom data indexing instead of using APIs and advanced analytics will give users on our platform an edge vs. using others. We leverage zkLogin for ease of access and eventually Walrus for storing Profile data and Platform Usage Points.
