## Project Description

Vendetta is a fully on-chain, text-based, MORTS (Multiplayer online real-time strategy) game on SUI blockchain, where players build their empire from the ground up to create their own criminal empire by capturing turfs, allying with other players and earning cash and resources from different activities in the city.

Vendetta makes use of ZKLogin and transactions including sponsored tx with ENOKI to make a smooth onboarding experience for the players. A player can start the game with a simple google login and start playing immediately.
