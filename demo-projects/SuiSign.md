## Project Description

I'm building a DocuSign in sui version, fully leverageing Sui's technology such as ZK-login, ZK-send, Walrus and Sui NS.

- **ZK-login:** allows signers and recipients to quickly access the blockchain without needing to create a wallet in advance.
- **ZK-send:** with ZK-send, the document signature requester doesn't need additional personal information from the signer; all thatâ€™s required is to share a link.
- **Walrus:** Utilizes Walrus to temporarily store documents awaiting signature, so signers can easily access and review them.
- **Sui NS:** Using Sui's NS NFTs for verification, ensuring only authorized individuals are permitted to sign the documents.
- **Web2 KYC solution** using ZK-TLS technology by Reclaim protocol to secure the data source of personal information in website, allowing us to verify user's web identity
- **Programable Transaction Block:** by using the PTB, signers no longer need to prepare the gas in advnace

More updates will be added to GitHub repo ðŸš€
