## Project Description 

Rui is the first privacy-preserving onchain social media app on Sui. In Rui, users participate in anonymous polls featuring positive and complimentary statements about their peers within the same group, such as "Who was probably a cat in their past life?". The poll results are recorded onchain with users' anonymous identities, ensuring that only the recipient can recognize how many votes they received. By paying a fee, the recipient can choose to unlock and discover the names of those who voted for them.
