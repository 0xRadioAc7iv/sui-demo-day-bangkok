## Project Description 

Our platform is a pioneering memecoin NFT launchpad on the Sui blockchain, inspired by pump.fun but with a unique twist. Utilizing the ERC404 concept, it enables users to effortlessly launch their own NFT collections as coins, with the flexibility to convert them into NFTs and revert them back to coins as desired. This fluid, dual-state capability creates new opportunities for creators, enhancing both token utility and interactivity within the ecosystem. Ideal for creators aiming to engage communities with innovative, flexible token experiences, our platform makes launching and managing memecoins simple, secure, and dynamic.
