## Project Description

As a DeFi user, I often encounter situations where I want to switch (or exchange) assets that I'm borrowing or using as collateral in a lending protocol such as Navi. For example, if I want to switch a loan from USDT to USDC, I first need to repay the USDT debt before I can borrow USDC. However, sometimes I don't have enough USDT on hand to cover the debt first, leaving me stuck.
