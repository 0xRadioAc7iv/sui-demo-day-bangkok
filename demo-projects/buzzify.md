## Project Description

Buzzify is a prediction marketplace with a unique mechanism that rewards users based on proximity to accurate predictions rather than a binary yes/no model. The platform targets social media engagement metrics, such as content creator views, likes, and subscribers, allowing users to earn by predicting creators' next engagement scores.

Buzzifyâ€™s standout feature is its relative score calculation and reward distribution, which ensures that users gain more by getting closer to the correct prediction and lose less if theyâ€™re off the mark. The platform is designed for social media users, particularly degens and fan clubs, providing a gamified experience with options for prediction and earning. Users are incentivized through randomized score calculations, and predictions become engaging as no one may achieve exact accuracy, allowing for competitive play.

Buzzifyâ€™s user engagement strategy includes risk-free, gamified interactions where users can familiarize themselves with the mechanism by playing with non-monetary tokens. Fan clubs can compete within their circles, and degens can explore the mechanics. To promote activity, the platform will host events, giveaways, and small prizes, as well as offer airdrops and unique rewards for early users, generating excitement around its mainnet launch. The referral program and influencer promotions will amplify user onboarding.

The platform is flexible and can extend beyond content creator engagement predictions, allowing users to explore prediction options in areas like cryptocurrency values, protocol liquidity, and other DeFi metrics. This gamified experience ultimately offers a broad range of earning and engagement options.

More updates will be added to GitHub repo ðŸš€
