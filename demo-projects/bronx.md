## Project Description

Looking across the pond, one obvious growing lending platform yielding 5-7% APR while doubling in US
Dollar value every year is the Bitcoin Lightning Network. However, there is no easy way to bridge
across this infrastructure, it is best to do so via Zero-Knowledge Proof as Lightning is built upon.
We use a technology called Atomic Swap making use of Bitcoin's Timelock to allow Preimage trading
and unlock USDC on Sui side to be unlocked from Bronte vault. 

Many opportunities exist on the incentives side seeing that we are introducing a tokenless DeFi.
Bronx is ready to introduce limited Non-Fungible Tokens which waive fees for large swappers allowing
Hedge Funds to use this trustless system as a jumping off point in participating in the most active
orderbook in the cryptocurrency world. This is an opportunity to bootstrap institutional liquidity
on top of the Sui network, which is built on trustless resource-oriented architecture (ROA).
