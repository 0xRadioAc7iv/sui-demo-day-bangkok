## Project Description

Gugupay is a decentralized payment solution on the Sui blockchain that enables merchants to easily receive payments from customers via QR codes. Customers can pay directly with their Sui wallet using Sui tokens, which are automatically converted to stablecoin-equivalent amounts based on live exchange rates from the Pyth oracle. This approach removes the need for customers to hold stablecoins, simplifying the payment process while ensuring the merchant receives a stable value. With Gugupay, merchants can offer a seamless, crypto-based payment method thatâ€™s accessible and straightforward for customers.
