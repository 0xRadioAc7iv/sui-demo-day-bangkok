## Project Description 

EventuraX is a networking event management solution designed to streamline event creation and attendee engagement. Event managers can create multiple events, set entry fees, and easily manage participant invitations. After a user completes onboarding and creates a profile, event managers can browse through these profiles and send direct invitations to selected participants. Invited users enjoy free event access, provided they accept the invitation.
Users browsing the platform can explore various events and join by paying the entry fee. Users can connect with other attendees by sending networking requests, which the recipient must accept to establish a connection. The platform creates an engaging environment for professional networking, allowing users to discover new opportunities and build meaningful connections.
