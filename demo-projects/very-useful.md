## Project Description 

We're building **Very Useful** project that leverages AI to automate smart contract development with Sui Move, increasing productivity and reducing costs by extending the knowledge capacity of large language models, with a focus on delivering 2 main things:

- **Gas Optimization with AI:** Gas optimization typically requires experienced engineers to write code that minimizes computational and storage access. AI can assist by reviewing SUI smart contracts and generating human-readable reports with gas optimization suggestions.
- **Custom Oracle Deployment:** Integrating Pyth Oracle to deploy a dynamic oracle that sources real-time data from Pyth that AI calculating key metrics such as volatility, liquidity and price trends and can then be utilized in DeFi options, prediction markets or other DeFi applications.

More updates will be added to our GitHub repo :)
